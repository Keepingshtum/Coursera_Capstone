# Coursera_Capstone
This will hold all the files for the Coursera project!
Please look at the file list to see the Jupyter Notebook.

EDIT 20/08/2019: The notebook is now complete! Hurray! Peruse it at your pleasure.

Please note that the map won't be showing up as such because of some weird quirk of Github I haven't figured out yet.
One can download the notebook/map and see the results for themselves.
Uploading all relevant datasets for the same.
